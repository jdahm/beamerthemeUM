# UM Beamer Theme

I needed a theme for my presentation at a recent conference (January 2014).
The Ann Arbor theme is awful in my opinion, so I took a started creating my
own.  This theme tries to use the official colors so as to be in accordance
with the official [University of Michigan
Brand](http://vpcomm.umich.edu/brand/).  Feel free to suggest
additions/changes.
